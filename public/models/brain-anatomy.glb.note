This is a placeholder note for the brain anatomy 3D model.

The current system uses placeholder 3D models built with Three.js primitives when this GLB file is not available. The placeholder includes:

- A spherical cerebrum (main brain)
- A cylindrical brainstem 
- A smaller spherical cerebellum
- Interactive regions for frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes

To add a real 3D brain model:
1. Create or obtain a segmented brain GLB file
2. Name it 'brain-anatomy.glb' 
3. Place it in this directory
4. Ensure it has properly named mesh parts that match the region mapping in RealisticBrainModel.tsx

The current placeholder system will automatically switch to the real model when available.
